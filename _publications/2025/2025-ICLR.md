  Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because the conservative objectives used by offline algorithms must be gradually released during fine-tuning. Naively removing these objectives often destabilizes training, while keeping them uniformly suppresses adaptation. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Alignment for Release, a method that estimates the alignment of each sample with the offline policy and uses this signal to decide where conservative objectives should be released during fine-tuning. DARE first trains a state-conditional diffusion model to capture the offline behavioral distribution and incorporates Q-based energy guidance to improve the quality of this distribution modeling. For each sample, the KL divergence between the generated and actual actions is computed, and fits their distribution with a Gaussian to determine a dynamic exchange threshold. This enables selectively relaxing conservative objectives by partitioning each batch into offline-like and online-like subsets, which are then optimized with offline and online objectives respectively. We integrate DARE into Cal-QL and IQL and evaluate it on the D4RL benchmarks. Theoretical analysis proves that DARE contracts the offline/online discrepancy while keeping value estimation stable, and empirical evaluations on the D4RL benchmark show that DARE consistently improves both adaptability and training stability. (Code will be released upon acceptance.)
